# The Odin Project - Recipe Website

This project assigned by The Odin Project--which is to create a recipe website--will demonstrate my ability to use foundational level HTML elements in order to create basic webpages.

It will test my ability to create a site with headers, paragraphs, lists, images, as well relative and absolute links. I also hope to be able to improve my skill at writing commit messages once this project is completed.
