# The Odin Project - Recipe Website

This project assigned by The Odin Project--which is to create a recipe website--will demonstrate my ability to use foundational level HTML elements in order to create basic webpages.

It will test my ability to create a site with headers, paragraphs, lists, images, as well relative and absolute links. I also hope to be able to improve my skill at writing commit messages once this project is completed.

Edit 19/11/2023:
-I have decided to continue revisting this project and will be adding new elements to the site whenever I learn them. I have picked up a lot of CSS since beginning this project and I will begin to make some layout/style changes to the content for now.
-Icon Attributions will be added to the bottom of the README.
