            <h4>Just...why?</h4>
            <p>Well, this so-called "website" was made as part of a web developer course that I'm currently doing.</p>
            <p>It's my first project.</p>
            <p>That probably explains why it looks so lame eh? ;]</p>
            <h4>But why is it so...y'know...quirky?</h4>
            <p>After looking at a lotta recipe websites to see how things are done...I just realised that there was somethin' missing...
            <p>DAD JOKES! Lotsa DAD JOKES!</p>
            <p>Oh and simplicity too.</p>
            <h4>What are you trying to say?</h4>
            <p>I really wanted to make something that would be fun and easy for folks of all ages to follow!</p>
            <h4>OK...but what's with all the rhymes?!</h4>
            <p>Rhyming is awesome! All the cool dudes rhyme! Like...y'know...that cool dude that everyone likes...</p>
            <h4>Uh-huh</h4>
            <h4>But...Ummm...only 3 recipes?</h4>
            <p>For now!</p>
            <h4>I wanna learn web-design too!</h4>
            <p>Well today is your lucky day m'lad. Click this conveniently placed <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">link</a> to be taken to the same (#free-of-charge, #notspon) course that I'm doing...</p>
            <p>I'm totally sure that when you gotta make your own recipe site It'll be really awesome!</p>
            <h4>Umm, I'm outta questions...uhhh...subs or dubs?</h4>
            <p>I don't know what that means...</p>
            <h4>What do you mean? Aren't you the one who wrote this whole conversation?</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 40px;">...</p>
