    <p>Cookies are like these round things which you can eat. They’re really cool and taste great.</p>
    <p>Weirdly, there’s no recipe for cookies on here (yet!). But you can totally buy them from a store if you want. Or not. Whatever. But, like, you really should man. </p>
    <p>Apparently they were invented a really long time ago, so by now you probably already know what they are. You may have already tried one at some point in your life. You may even have eaten one today.</p>
    <p>But I’ll explain them to you anyway. Some of the ingredients include flour (I think)...And maybe eggs? Ooh ooh...I know there’s definitely some sugar in there. But don’t quote me on that.</p>
    <p>Anyway at this point, you may be asking yourself "Did they really create this page, and write all this nonsense, for the sake of making some lame joke about ridiculously long web/http cookie disclaimer sections on websites?"</p>
    <p>Yes. That’s exactly what’s happened.</p>
